###  Project Overview 

The Stockholm Cholera Outbreak of August 1853 was a historical event during which cholera, a waterborne disease, spread throughout the city. Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae and leads to severe diarrhea and dehydration. This outbreak was a significant public health concern because it led to the death of about 3,000 people.

 ### Data Cleaning And Transformation 
This Dataset was recorded and received in Swedish language. I had to first translate it to English using the Google Translate tool. The dataset has only 8 columns and 249 active rows with a lot of unwanted values and irrelevant and unprintable characters. The Column names after translation are ‘Date of death’, ‘Name’, ‘Profession’, ‘Sex’, ‘Age’, ‘Assembly’, ‘Archive Ref’, as well as ‘Page’. The Dataset has gone through several processes of standardizing before creating the dashboard. From the “TRIM” function to the “CLEAN”, Replacement of unwanted values, Removing of Errors, and so on. I created several other Columns like “Month Name”, “Day Name”, and a conditional Column named “Age Categories”, using Ages 1–11 as Children, Ages 12–19 as Teenagers, Ages 20–30 as Young Adult, Ages 31–40 as Adult, Ages 41–50 as Senior and Ages 51 and Above as Aged This Transformation process was successfully completed using the Power query editor before loading the Dataset to Power BI Desktop for further insights and Visualization.
